\begin{exercise}{0}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe the language of the following regular expression in words:
      \[r= (0+1)^*0(0+1)^*0(0+1)^*.\]
    \item Construct the regular expression for\ldots
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item the set of all strings with at most one pair of consecutive $0$'s and at most one pair of consecutive $1$'s,
        \item the set of all strings with equal number of $0$'s and $1$'s such that no prefix has two more $0$'s than $1$'s nor two more $1$'s than $0$'s.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Construct a context free grammar (CFG) for a set of strings of $\{(,)\}^*$ such that every string of the set has equal number of left and right parenthesis, and every prefix has at least as many left parenthesis as  right parenthesis.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The set of all strings containing at least two $0$'s.
    \item
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item The regular expression is: 
        %maybe next time use a different exercise. There is always a problem with this solution.
        %the below solution is using model checking tools proven to be equivalent to the LTL formula 
        % NOT(0 AND X0)W(0 AND X0 AND XGNOT(0 AND X0)) AND NOT(1 AND X1)W(1 AND X1 AND XGNOT(1 AND X1))
        %= ~(00)W(00 & XG~(00)) & ~(11)W(11 & XG~(11))
        %so if the LTL formula corrently models the specification, the regex should also be correct.
          \begin{align*}
          (0+\eps)(10)^*(01)^*(10)^*(1+\eps) \\
          +(0+\eps)(10)^*(01)^*0 \\
          +(1+\eps)(01)^*(10)^*(01)^*(0+\eps) \\
          +(1+\eps)(01)^*(10)^*1 \\
          \end{align*}
	    \item The regular expression is:
          \[(01 + 10)^*\]
      \end{enumerate}
    \item The CFG is:
      \[S \to (\ S \ ) \ S \mid \eps\]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
